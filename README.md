A basic Raytracer implementation for the first assignment of CENG477-Introduction to Computer Graphics course in METU. 

Ray tracing is a fundamental rendering algorithm. It is commonly used for animations and architectural simulations, in which the quality of the created images is more important than the time
it takes to create them.simulates the propagation of light in real world.

# CENG477-Raytracer

A basic Raytracer implementation for the first assignment of CENG477-Introduction to Computer Graphics course in METU. 

Ray tracing is a fundamental rendering algorithm. It is commonly used for animations and architectural simulations, in which the quality of the created images is more important than the time it takes to create them.

It is enough to run the executable via command “./raytracer scene.xml”. (Example XML scene files can be found in scene_files directory.)

Some of the rendered output images can be seen below:
(Related input XML scene files in scene_files directory)
